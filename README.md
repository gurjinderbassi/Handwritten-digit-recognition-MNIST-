# Handwritten-digit-recognition-MNIST-
The MNIST dataset is one of the most common datasets used for image classification and accessible from many different sources. In fact, even Tensorflow and Keras allow us to import and download the MNIST dataset directly from their API. 
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images taken from American Census Bureau employees and American high school students.
These images are grayscale images of size 28X28.
The task is to design a Convolutional neural network that can correctly classify the input image into one of the possible classes (0 to 9).
